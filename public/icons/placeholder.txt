Please add the following icon files to this directory:

1. icon-192x192.png - 192x192 pixels
2. icon-512x512.png - 512x512 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editing software or online tools like:
- https://www.canva.com/
- https://www.figma.com/
- https://www.photopea.com/

The icons should be in PNG format with transparent backgrounds.

For best results:
- Use the app's branding colors
- Make sure the icon is legible at small sizes
- Leave some padding around the edges
- Use a simple, recognizable design

Once you've created the icons, place them in this directory and delete this placeholder file.
